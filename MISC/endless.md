>Whoops! I deleted the file ending of this file, and now I can't seem to figure out what type of file it was. Can you help me?

### Solution

We are given a file without a file ending, luckily it seems like my computer automatically turned it into an mp3 file :skull:

Listening to the file we hear a person speaking out the flag. English comprehension challenge fr.
```The content of this flag is all lowercase, except for the flag wrapper LITCTF f0udao4rtbsp6```


### Flag

```LITCTF{f0udao4rtbsp6}```
